# My Oh-my-zsh configs

Here I will post all the themes created on my own that I use in my terminal. Nothing special, just a piece of beautyâœ¨

To install any of the themes provided here just download (or copy-paste) file with a theme you liked and move it to the following directory

```
~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```

Enjoy your terminal!ðŸŽ€
